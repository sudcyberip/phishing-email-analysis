## üîß Tools Used  
- üß© **CyberChef** ‚Üí for decoding and analyzing encoded strings  
- üñºÔ∏è **ExifTool** ‚Üí for extracting metadata from attachments  
- üìë **GCK‚Äôs File Signatures Table** ‚Üí to verify file signatures & magic numbers  
- üìù **Notepad++** ‚Üí for analyzing raw email headers and content  
- üõ†Ô∏è **HxD** ‚Üí for hexadecimal file inspection

     ![Email Content Screenshot](images/sample_Email_with_AttachmentPdf.png)
     
   - Detected attachment disguised as a **PDF file** but actually a **ZIP archive**
       - This is the attachment pretending  pdf file with email
         [üìÑ View  (PDF)](pretending-to-be-attached-pdf_file/PuzzleToCoCanDa.pdf)
       - Check the file signature number  of pdf file and getting the   signature number  of zip file

 3. **Attachment Analysis**  

    -The suspicious ZIP file contained **three files**. Their analysis is summarized below:

    | File Name     | Observed Content / Behavior | Suspicious Indicators |
    |---------------|-----------------------------|------------------------|
    | `GoodJobMajor.pdf` | Embedded message about **kidnapping people** and demand for **1 billion** ransom.. | Fake extension, used as a lure. |
    | `DaughtersCrown.jpeg`   | Contained a picture of a **crown**;  | Fake extension , strong phishing indicator. |
    | `Money.xlsx`   | Showed **suspicious hidden content** and irregular metadata. | Possible malware delivery vector or data exfiltration attempt. |
     ---
     -All three Suspicious file Below

 ‚úÖ Based on the above, all three files are **malicious artifacts** confirming the phishing nature of the email.
